For example, for Hindus, it is said to mark the return of Lord Rama to\nAyodhya, after his 14-year exile and defeat of King Ravana. Since they returned on\na new moon night (Amavasya), the citizens of Ayodhya lit diyas all over to illuminate the\ncity in their jubilant welcome.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maturing\">Present Day</h2>\n<p><em>Maturing</em></p>\n<p>As is the nature of history, traditions evolve. Since then, modern India looks to\ncelebrate the festival of lights with as much pomp and glamour as one can imagine. Fireworks\nare lit all over the world as part of celebrations, and they have always been quite\na pleasing sight for the eyes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ignition\">Impact</h2>\n<p><em>Ignition</em></p>\n<p>However, as pleasing as it is, a look at the statistics quickly reveals the environmental impact\nof Diwali celebrations. Fireworks produce high levels of air pollution, and the smoke and\nparticulate matter can cause serious health issues, especially for those with pre-existing\nrespiratory problems.</p>\n<p>Consequences of the celebration last all winter. The current AQI is deemed “SEVERE” - even\nhealthy individuals can develop respiratory illnesses.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6625239/\">2019 study</a> conducted by\nresearchers in Pune shows that a person can be exposed to anywhere between 4.8 and\n64.5 PPM of PM 2.5 within a few minutes.\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_guideline\">WHO’s air quality guidelines</a>\nrecommend an average of 0.025 PPM as safe.</p>\n<h2 id=\"illumination\">Visualization</h2>\n<p><em>Illumination</em></p>\n<p>Now imagine a population of 1.408B Indian people collectively celebrate Diwali by bursting\ncrackers and fireworks at the same time.</p>\n<p><em>Can’t?
