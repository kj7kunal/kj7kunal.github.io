Team Indus is a private for-profit aerospace company that was all geared up at\nwinning the <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/prizes/google-lunar/competing-teams\">Google Lunar X Prize competition</a>. I had designed some mathematical models and simulations for thruster\nmisalignment estimation during various burn phases, mainly in MATLAB.</p>\n<h3 id=\"application\">Application Process</h3>\n<p>The application process was tricky. I could not find an “open positions” page\nonline. And if you have ever been to the ISRO website, it’s really hard to find\nwhat you’re looking for. No, my best friend here, was networking.</p>\n<p>I had heard about the <a href=\"https://www.iist.ac.in/\">Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology</a> having direct ties with ISRO, and that students usually go for internships at\nvarious labs across the entire space agency. Through a bit of googling, I found a\nlist of students who had interned at the ISRO Satellite Centre the previous summer,\nand through a bit of facebooking, I found one student with a close mutual friend.\nI soon scheduled a call with her, and she turned out be a really interesting person.\nWe talked about her project which was based on robotics, as well as her university life.\nShe set me up for a call with her mentor, who was also a graduate from her university.</p>\n<h3 id=\"interview\">Interview Call</h3>\n<p>My call with my mentor, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arallapalli\">Mr Aditya R.</a>, basically involved\na CV runthrough, an extensive discussion about my work at Team Indus, and a free-talk\nabout my interests and projects at IIT Kharagpur. To my relief, he said he was looking\nfor interns and my resume matched his requirements. More luckily, I got to choose between\n2 projects to work on!</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"></code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"project\">The Project</h2>\n<h3 id=\"objectives\">Objectives</h3>\n<p>The goal of the project was to simulate active space debris removal using tether-net\nconnected to satellites in formation. There were 3 main concepts involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spacecraft formation flying. This topic is well explored and enough literature was\navailable. It involved relative position control combined with orbital mechanics.</li>\n<li>Tether net modelling. The behaviour of the net had to be described as a spatially\ndistributed mechanical system.</li>\n<li>Contact dynamics. The collective behaviour of the net and the satellites in formation\nduring and after debris contact phases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h3>\n<p>Among many things, space is also the most dangerous junkyard Earth has created.\nIf you have seen the 2013 film Gravity, the accident that caused the astronauts\nto break off from the ship was due to the debris in space.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"/b8628ebf5324809a1b1de33a9883d6af/gravity_debris_accident.gif\" alt=\"Gravity Accident\">\n</p>\n<p>It is estimated that there are 600,000 debris fragments ranging from 1~10 cm,\nand on average one satellite is destroyed by collision with space junk each year.\nIf satellites are not disposed of properly, the parts could become high-speed bullets\nleading to a chain reaction of collisions, a theoretical scenario popularly known\nas the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\">Kessler Syndrome</a>.\nApart from dramatic accidents, such a scenario could lead to serious consequences\nincluding unusable orbits or communication blackouts.</p>\n<p>A number of cleanup efforts have been explored/proposed in recent years - robotic\ngrappling arms, harpoons, deploying nets, electrodynamic tethers, ground-based lasers, etc.</p>\n<p>This project combined swarm satellites and tether-nets for Active Space Debris Removal.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h3>\n<p>Simulations for the various components were developed in MATLAB and working code was\nreplicated in C++ for faster experimentation. A C++ library implementation for MATLAB’s\nmatrix/vector manipulation was developed which reduced simulation time by 5 times\nand allowed easy code porting.</p>\n<h4>Spacecraft formation flying</h4>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 576px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f28b120c63c9e77f643cab5ac1f70c54/533c1/satellite_swarm.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 70.27027027027026%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Satellite swarm\" title=\"Satellite swarm\" src=\"/static/f28b120c63c9e77f643cab5ac1f70c54/533c1/satellite_swarm.png\" srcset=\"/static/f28b120c63c9e77f643cab5ac1f70c54/12f09/satellite_swarm.png 148w,\n/static/f28b120c63c9e77f643cab5ac1f70c54/e4a3f/satellite_swarm.png 295w,\n/static/f28b120c63c9e77f643cab5ac1f70c54/533c1/satellite_swarm.png 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n</p>\n<p>Relative orbit dynamics of two objects in close orbits, can be modelled using the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clohessy%E2%80%93Wiltshire_equations\">Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (HCW) equations</a>.

However, due to lack of sponsorship and funds, I was not able\nto attend the conference.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"></code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"experience\">My Experience</h2>\n<p>As an aerospace engineering student, I was very enthusiastic about working at the\nISRO Satellite Centre, and I was very excited to fly to Bangalore as soon as my\nsummer vacation started.</p>\n<p>Since I was an “unofficial” intern, I was not given any stipend, and I had to cut\nmy costs by staying at my uncle’s place - about an hour of bus travel each day.\nBut also because of that, I had the benefits of working flexibly in terms of\nhours and place of work.</p>\n<p>My first week at ISAC, my mentor introduced me to the team at the Control\nDynamics and Simulation Group, who were mostly graduates from IIST. They were\nreally friendly, and talking to them was like talking to any senior from college.\nThere were 3 more interns from different universities, who had their own\nstories of how they got their internships.</p>\n<p>I usually started work at 10AM and ended work around 4PM. My mentor and I synced\nup twice each week and discussed work updates every day. It motivated me to stay\non track. Since I could be flexible, I sometimes used to work from cafes near my\nplace instead of going to office. My mentor was super approachable, and I could\ncall him up in the middle of the night to discuss a sudden idea I had. I also\nsynced up with the group’s project director, <a href=\"https://www.siliconindia.com/profiles/dr-vinod-kumar-XEac3AFM.html\">Dr Vinod Kumar</a>, a few times, who told me about his long\njourney at ISRO.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed such 1on1 sessions. They helped me connect with the team better. I also\nloved the two <em>chai breaks</em>, where employees used to line up for free tea/coffee\nand free talk. In some of these, my mentor and the other team members used to\ntake us for tours of the Satellite Centre. It was unbelievable seeing the mission\ncontrol for the recently launched <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia_Satellite\">GSAT-9</a>\nand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSAT-11\">GSAT-11</a> in development, right in front of our eyes!</p>\n<p>However, amongst all things shiny, there were things that stood out\nthat I could not help feeling irritated about. Offices were similar to old Indian\ngovernment offices desperately in need of an upgrade. Some of the PCs we used to\nwork on were still equipped with age-old hardware like CRT monitors. My team’s\noffice was a room divided into cubicles, which my mentor said made him feel\nclaustrophobic at times. I used to see more progress when I was working on my\nlaptop from a cafe than when I was working in a no-window office all day.</p>\n<p>I learned a lot talking to my colleagues. The engineers/scientists shared a lot\nof career insight, which had helped me gear up into changing my career in the\ncoming months. I discussed about some ML projects I worked on in college, and\nI learned how it was applied in projects at ISRO. Discussions that could not be\ncompleted over <em>chai breaks</em> were continued the next day or free pizza treats\nafter work!</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; margin: 0 0 30px;\">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/7291d20fb873e9d83312bd236408512f/47311/free_pizzaaa.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 82.43243243243244%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Pizza Treats\" title=\"Pizza Treats\" src=\"/static/7291d20fb873e9d83312bd236408512f/1c72d/free_pizzaaa.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/7291d20fb873e9d83312bd236408512f/a80bd/free_pizzaaa.jpg 148w,\n/static/7291d20fb873e9d83312bd236408512f/1c91a/free_pizzaaa.jpg 295w,\n/static/7291d20fb873e9d83312bd236408512f/1c72d/free_pizzaaa.jpg 590w,\n/static/7291d20fb873e9d83312bd236408512f/a8a14/free_pizzaaa.jpg 885w,\n/static/7291d20fb873e9d83312bd236408512f/47311/free_pizzaaa.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The ISRO Internship","date":"August 01, 2020","description":"Research intern experience at ISRO Satellite Centre"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/isro-intern/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/more-about/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the creator"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/ntu-intern/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Summer Internship at NTU Singapore"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
